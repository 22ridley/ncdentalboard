            The NC State Board of Dental Examiners has issued the attached Order

            during the state of emergency following Hurricane Helene. In short,
            certain Board requirements addressing piped water and functioning
            toilets are waived in dental offices located within the FEMA
            designated disaster zone. Dentists are instead directed to consult
            and comply with North Carolina and federal agencies directives for
            the safe reopening of dental practices after disruption of a water
            source. Link to the Order:

            Update to all General Anesthesia Permit Holders Regarding Office
            Inspections
          </h2>
          <p>
            In 2019, at the direction of the State Auditor, the NC State Board
            of Dental Examiners began the process of implementing a general
            anesthesia/sedation office inspection program. The stated goal of
            the program was to ensure each dental office that offers anesthesia
            or sedation services is inspected at least once every five years. At
            the onset of the program, the NCSBDE agreed to accept the American
            Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (A.A.O.M.S.)
            inspection for general anesthesia permit holders in lieu of a Board
            inspection. The acceptance of the A.A.O.M.S. inspection was
            considered a temporary measure during the COVID-19 State of
            Emergency so that the Board could focus the program primarily on
            sedation permit holders who were not subject to on-going inspections
            by any agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, the NCSBDE made the decision to start phasing out the
            acceptance of the A.A.O.M.S. inspection reports for general
            anesthesia permit holders and to start phasing in the NCSBDE
            inspections. This decision was made due to the passing of the
            COVID-19 State of Emergency and recent court rulings that prohibit
            state agencies from allowing private associations to fulfill state
            agency obligations. Therefore, please be advised that Inspector Rick
            Hetzel will be contacting General Anesthesia permit holders soon to
            start scheduling these inspections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of these inspections is not to initiate disciplinary
            action, but to make certain all offices meet the training,
            equipment, and facility requirements of the appropriate rule, and to
            ensure any necessary corrective action is taken to protect the
            public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Offices subject to inspections will receive advanced notice of the
            proposed inspection. Once an inspection date is agreed upon, a
            checklist of everything that will be subject to inspection will be
            provided. Again, this is a safety program that focuses on required
            equipment, training, and documentation. It will be conducted with as
            little disruption to your schedule as possible. If you have any
            questions, please contact Inspector Rick Hetzel at 828-578-4817 or
